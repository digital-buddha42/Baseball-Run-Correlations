Proposal
      For our first project we were inspired by sabermetrics, the empirical analysis of baseball, 
to examine different facets of offensive play in the MLB and their relationship to the number of 
runs scored in a game. We aimed to find any meaningful or interesting correlations between runs 
scored per game and various other statistics. We have found that overall, there has been less than 
a 1 run difference between any decade over a one hundred years. With a high value of 4.975 
runs/game in the 1930s, and a low value of just over 4.052 in the 1960’s, there has been 
considerable change in the amount of runs per game. Our most recent data from the 2010s shows 
that there has been a drop in the number of runs per game; in fact, this last decade yields the 
lowest runs/game since the 1950s. Given that this statistic does not negatively correlate strongly 
with any of the offensive stats we have examined, it may be prudent to turn to defensive statistics 
to uncover what factors may cause a decline in runs per game. After looking at the hitting data 
collected by sabermetricians (sourced from baseball-reference.com) and finding the correlation 
between several variables, we decided to perform analyses on stolen bases, batting average, and 
on-base slugging percentage (OPS) from 1920 to 2019 to uncover what offensive statistics may 
cause an increase in runs per game. 

Analysis
      First, we looked at stolen bases; plotting the data in a scatter plot and calculating the r-
value, we revealed a negligible positive correlation between the number of bases stolen and runs 
per game (0.067). We can conclude that stealing has very little impact on the number of runs per 
game or that other factors have greater impact which rend stealing obsolete insofar as its ability 
to predict runs. Considering the practice of stealing bases carries with it the inherent risk of 
losing a runner should they be caught stealing, this may explain why we see a drop in stolen 
bases in post-Moneyball baseball. Since the Oakland Athletics and General Manager Billy Beane 
embraced a data-driven approach in 2002, professional teams have focused increasingly on the 
numbers behind the game. 
      Using the same methodology for batting average yielded a much higher correlation, with 
an r-value of 0.879 and a tidy scatter plot. However, OPS, had the highest correlation to number 
of runs per game, with an r-value of 0.895. Both batting average and OPS could be used to 
predict with an acceptable degree of uncertainty number of runs scored as they have correlation 
coefficients approaching .9, meaning there is a definite positive relationship between both stats 
and runs per game. This result is in line with expectations, as we would expect these offensive 
metrics to align, especially OPS which was devised specifically to improve on batting average’s 
predication of run scoring by combining the weighted hitting metric, slugging percentage, with 
on-base percentage. 
      We also wanted to look at how runs per game, stolen bases per game, batting average, 
and OPS have changed over time. We plotted three scatter plots to visualize the data, one with all 
four categories, one with just the runs/game, and one without the runs/game. Separating the 
runs/game from the other three allowed better visualization of our findings, as the scale on which 
the data was plotted could be more precise. We decided to do a second visualization of the 
aggregated data as a set of box-and-whisker plots to identify any outliers. In doing so, we 
discovered that batting average and OPS both have numerous outliers when sorting by decade, 
while stolen bases has very few. Should we pursue further research, it would be interesting to 
investigate what factors contributed to the batting average and OPS stats of the outlier years. 

Conclusion
	We set out to uncover what statistics correlated most closely with runs scored, and found 
that while batting average and OPS both correlate highly, stolen bases is very lowly correlated to 
runs scored per game. We uncovered interesting trends in the data which may lend themselves to 
further analysis. For example, based on what we found on stolen bases, we could look for other 
statistics that were affected by the systemic adoption of data analytics in the early 2000s. 
	As noted in the proposal, we chose to focus on offensive statistics for this project, with 
the intention of limiting the scope of our analysis. However, in doing so we were not able to 
consider any potential negative correlations between defensive statistics and the number of runs 
scored per game. Focusing on offense better suits the intended breadth and scope of this project, 
but it remains an important limitation in our dataset to note.
